    "*Hardware* - the physical devices that make up the computer  \n",
    "*CPU* - the hardware component that executes the code and directs other hardware^[Also called the *central processing unit*]  \n",
    "*Main Memory* - the computer's work area, held in special chips called RAM  \n",
    "*RAM* - the hardware component that holds main memory.^[Short for \"Random Access Memory\"]  \n",
    "*Secondary Storage* - a place where our programs can store longterm data, held in some kind of drive usually solid state or on a disk.^[USB drives also function as a place for secondary storage to be located]  \n",
    "*Operating System* - A program that dictates how a user and other programs can interact with the hardware of the computer  \n",
    "*Software* / *Program* - A set of ordered instructions given to the computer to accomplish some task.  \n",
    "*Input Device* - A piece of hardware that can gather input from outside the computer.^[Commonly these are: mice, keyboards, touch screens, scanners, microphones, cameras, and other devices connected to the computer]  \n",
    "*Output Device* - A piece of hardware that displays information created by a program.^[Commonly these are: video displays, printers, and sometimes secondary storage could be considered an output device if the data being stored is meant to be used in another context]  \n",
    "*Binary* - The number system that allows us to store information as electrical signals for use in a computer. The digits are `0` and `1`.  \n",
    "*IDE* - The development environment where we write code to be executed. Python has a special IDE called *IDLE* intended to help you learn python.\n",

    "## How the Computer Stores Data\n",
    "- Electricity and circuits don't handle partial information well meaning we can't divide our numbering system into 10 pieces like we would normally in math. Instead what we *can* do is represent and store a series of high and low pulses of electricity.\n",
    "- If we only have two digits (`0` and `1` corresponding to a low and high pulse respectively) in our number system we are counting in *binary*\n",
    "- An unending series of binary digits is unwieldy and hard to work with, so most computers today deal with groups of digits called a *byte* with enough information to store a small number or a single letter.\n",
    "  - To represent a number we can count the number of binary digits (also called a *bit*) in the number and use the bit's position to get how many of each power of 2 is in a number counting starting with 0 and the furthest right digit moving left.\n",
    "    - This means that `10101011` in binary is equal to $1 \\times 2^7 + 0 \\times 2^6 + 1 \\times 2^5 + 0 \\times 2^4 + 1 \\times 2^3 + 0 \\times 2^2 + 1 \\times 2 + 1 = $"
