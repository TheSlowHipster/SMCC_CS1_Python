# The Hardware and Your Program
### Glossary
*Hardware* - the physical devices that make up the computer
*CPU* - the hardware component that executes the code and directs other hardware^[Also called the *central processing unit*]
*Main Memory* - the computer's work area, held in special chips called RAM
*RAM* - the hardware component that holds main memory.^[Short for "Random Access Memory"]
*Secondary Storage* - a place where our programs can store longterm data, held in some kind of drive usually solid state or on a disk.^[USB drives also function as a place for secondary storage to be located]
*Operating System* - A program that dictates how a user and other programs can interact with the hardware of the computer
*Software* / *Program* - A set of ordered instructions given to the computer to accomplish some task.
*Input Device* - A piece of hardware that can gather input from outside the computer.^[Commonly these are: mice, keyboards, touch screens, scanners, microphones, cameras, and other devices connected to the computer]
*Output Device* - A piece of hardware that displays information created by a program.^[Commonly these are: video displays, printers, and sometimes secondary storage could be considered an output device if the data being stored is meant to be used in another context]
*Binary* - The number system that allows us to store information as electrical signals for use in a computer. The digits are `0` and `1`.
*IDE* - The development environment where we write code to be executed. Python has a special IDE called *IDLE* intended to help you learn
